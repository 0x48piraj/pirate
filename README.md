## Introduction

This Pi Day, πrate is going to end privacy. All personal information that has ever existed or will ever exist, the genetic code sequence of every being in the universe, can be found just by using **πrate**.

You can find your identity related information which makes you, you! say, your name, date of birth, CCV number and even your unique genetic code sequence!

### That's scary, πrate stores my personal information!?

We **do not** share your personal information, we just display the locations where your information is, like a GPS Navigator. It means, all your personal information are still there, quietly sitting in π &mdash; they're never going away, you can't scrub the digits, can you?

And not only yours, That's right! Every person you've ever met, or anyone else has met or will meet! [Data Protection Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy_law)? All of it is in π! They were always there!

### So I've looked up my personal information in π, what did I gain?

Nothing.

### Why you created this?

Think of a scenario where you forgot your credit card number, what will you do? You will have to get it revoked and stuff.
But, what if you've written them down somewhere; you could use a piece of paper, a post-it-note so to say but your friendly neighbourhood Billy can look upto it and cause trouble. Use πrate to create an unique seq and no-one will understand what the seq means and by merely using πrate again, you can retrive your credit card number!

### Why Chunking Data?

Well, this is just an initial prototype, we all know that it can take a while to find a long sequence of digits in π, so for practical reasons, we should break the long strings up into smaller chunks that can be more readily found, but don't worry, there's always Moore's law!

### Why Pi?

Pi's ubiquity goes beyond math. The number crops up in the natural world, too. It appears everywhere there's a circle, of course, such as the disk of the sun, the spiral of the DNA double helix, the pupil of the eye, the concentric rings that travel outward from splashes in ponds. Pi also appears in the physics that describes waves, such as ripples of light and sound. It even enters into the equation that defines how precisely we can know the state of the universe, known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

Finally, pi emerges in the shapes of rivers. A river's windiness is determined by its "meandering ratio," or the ratio of the river's actual length to the distance from its source to its mouth as the crow flies. Rivers that flow straight from source to mouth have small meandering ratios, while ones that lollygag along the way have high ones. Turns out, the average meandering ratio of rivers approaches — you guessed it — pi.

Albert Einstein was the first to explain this fascinating fact. He used fluid dynamics and chaos theory to show that rivers tend to bend into loops. The slightest curve in a river will generate faster currents on the outer side of the curve, which will cause erosion and a sharper bend. This process will gradually tighten the loop, until chaos causes the river to suddenly double back on itself, at which point it will begin forming a loop in the other direction.

Because the length of a near-circular loop is like the circumference of a circle, while the straight-line distance from one bend to the next is diameter-like, it makes sense that the ratio of these lengths would be pi-like.

### What are the chances?

100% for everything that's chunked. And nearly 100% for things like your name and your date of birth. For nerds, you can head over to https://example.com to see the funky Mathematics working behind.
